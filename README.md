# SQL-TOOLS

**Simple python package to help out in working with SQL database related operation.**

It is a python package which uses database (SQL) functionality to help the developer to perform SQL operations on their desired database. This project _aims_ the developer ring to fucus on their main code rather than fucusing on the database relatede headaches.

This python package uses the `sqlite3` functionality to store databases on the local and `My SQL` for directly connect with the database setup on the host.
