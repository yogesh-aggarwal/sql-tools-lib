# SQL-TOOLS

**Simple python package to help out in working with SQL database related operation.**

It is a python package which uses database (SQL) functionality to help the developer to perform SQL operations on their desired database. This project _aims_ the developer ring to focus on their main code rather than focusing on the database related headaches.

This python package uses the ```sqlite3``` functionality to store databases on the local and ```My SQL``` for directly connect with the database setup on the host.
